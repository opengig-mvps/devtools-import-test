# User Story Workflow Rules

## Project Name
For all requests take project name as "demo-5wdkn8aaz"

## Story Selection
- When fetching user stories:
  - Present stories for user selection
  - Allow user to select target stories for implementation by story title

## Error Handling
- On story fetch failure:
  - Verify project name with user
  - Prompt for correct project name if needed
  - Retry fetch with corrected name
  - Still error then ask user to directly provide task details to work on

## Technical Design Integration
- Before implementation:
  - Fetch technical designs for project
  - Filter relevant designs for selected story
  - Proceed without designs if fetch fails
  - In technical design there will be 2 fields `endpoints` and `pages`, endpoints refers to api endpoints and pages refers to pages in the frontend, api endpoints will be called using axios in pages in frontend

## Development Guidelines
- Package Manager:
  - Use pnpm exclusively
  - Ignore errors related to quotes, it is fine to have single or double quotes in the code.
  - If some import prefix like `@/` is used, then check config file and parse files accordingly.
  - use shadcn/ui components as much as possible

## Code Modification Rules
- File Editing:
  - Only modify files related to current task
  - Skip files with correct implementation and there is no errors

## Implementation Flow (only if user ask to work on user story)
1. Story Selection
2. Design Reference (if available)
3. Implementation
4. Validation
